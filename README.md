## gh-issue

It uses the `gh` cli tool (`brew install gh`) to fetch all the user assigned issues.

This script is more safe than many other, since you don't have to create manually a token, but the authentication part is delegated to the gh official tool.

It can be configured by specified a LOGIN name

## gh-pr

Like gh-issue, but show only the Pull Requests that the user has to review.
